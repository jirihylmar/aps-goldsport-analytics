## AI vs. Regular Search Comparison

### Google AI Filtering Effect

| Language | Regular Search | AI Overview | Reduction | Classic Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| English | 6+ schools | 6 schools | ~0% | ✅ Included (#2) |
| Czech | 6+ schools | 4 schools | ~33% | ✅ Included (#1) |
| German | Unknown | 1 school | ~83%+ | ❌ **EXCLUDED** |
| Polish | Unknown | 3 schools | Unknown | ⚠️ Weak mention |

**Pattern**: AI mode reduces school count by 30-50%. Being excluded = 40-50% of potential customers never see you.
